## Introduction

**HR Analytics**

Lines of business like the HR department, for instance,typically don't have timely or efficient access to data and information. Analysts gather the data manually, work with it on an individual basis, and then share copies of files through email or file servers. With Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Analytics Cloud, you can load and optimize data from a multitude of sources into a centralized data warehouse for analysis so departments can gain actionable insights.

This solution uses data in an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and then uses Oracle Analytics Cloud to analyze the data to provide actionable insights.

These lab guides provide directions on how one can install the HR schema available on the Oracle Autonomous Database. We will then show how to connect ADW to OAC and show a sample analysis with some refined data.

## Goals for this workshop
