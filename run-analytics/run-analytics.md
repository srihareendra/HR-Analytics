# Run Analytics - Create Dashboards

## Introduction

In this lab, you will use a DVA file to run analytics in Oracle Analytics Cloud.

## Objectives

As a system administrator or application developer:

- Create Connection to ADW  
- Upload DVA files and refresh connection + data
- View analytics

## Required Artifacts

- Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC) instances.
- Access to sql and dva files needed to recreate this demo.

### STEP 1: ADW Setup

- Log in to your already provisioned autonomous data warehouse (ADW) instance.

- Use SQL developer to connect to your database with the ADMIN user.

- After installing the HR schema, you should be able to see the following tables: EMPLOYEES, LOCATIONS, JOBS, COUNTRIES, DEPARTMENTS, REGIONS, JOB_HISTORY


### STEP 2: Analytics Cloud Setup

-  Log in to your analytics cloud instance. On the far right hamburger menu, select **Import Project/Flow**

-  Import the 'Human Resources.dva' file into OAC. The password is **Admin123**. Read more [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/bi/analytics-desktop/bidvd/import-application-or-project.html).
